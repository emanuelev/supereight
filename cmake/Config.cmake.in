# To include supereight in your project use:
#   find_package(supereight)
#
# This will define the following variables:
#   SUPEREIGHT_CORE_LIBS
#     The core octree library. You should always link against this library when
#     using supereight.
#
#   SUPEREIGHT_DENSESLAM_LIBS
#     The libraries compiled from se-denseslam. Link against ONE of them if you
#     want to use the supereight dense SLAM pipeline. Each one corresponds to
#     the se-denseslam pipeline compiled for a different value of the
#     SE_FIELD_TYPE macro. When linking against one of these libraries the
#     value of the SE_FIELD_TYPE macro is set automatically.
#
#     WARNING: Only one of the libraries in SUPEREIGHT_DENSESLAM_LIBS should be
#     linked against in a single executable since each one sets the
#     SE_FIELD_TYPE macro to a different value.
#
#   SUPEREIGHT_FIELD_TYPES
#     The respective values of the SE_FIELD_TYPE macro for the libraries in
#     SUPEREIGHT_DENSESLAM_LIBS. There is usually no need to manually define
#     this macro.
#
#
#
# Example 1: Using only the octree library.
#   find_package(supereight)
#   add_executable(example1 example1.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(example1 ${SUPEREIGHT_CORE_LIBS})
#
# Example 2: Using the dense SLAM pipeline with SDF field type. The contents of
# SUPEREIGHT_DENSESLAM_LIBS are: se-denseslam-sdf;se-denseslam-ofusion
#   find_package(supereight)
#   add_executable(example2 example2.cpp)
#   target_link_libraries(example2 ${SUPEREIGHT_CORE_LIBS} se-denseslam-sdf)
